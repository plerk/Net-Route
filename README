Net-Route

Every OS provides its custom interface to the routing table: Linux'
"route" utility is different from BSD's "route show", from Windows'
"route print", etc. Parsing all these different output styles in an
(otherwise portable) script can quickly become inconvenient.

Net::Route abstracts the system specifics and provides a single,
portable interface.
